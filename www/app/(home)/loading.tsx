        What is Football Pace?

      <Text>
        Football Pace is a version of the standings table that accounts for
        strength of schedule. It looks at historical data to see how a typical
        champion performs in each match, based on home/away and the opponent
        {"'"}s finishing position. It then presents a new version of the
        standings table, that shows how each team is doing compared to typical
        championship pace, given their schedule so far.
