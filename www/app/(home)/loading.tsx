        What is Football Pace?
      </Title>
      <Text>
        Football Pace is a version of the standings table that accounts for
        strength of schedule. Fans intuitively know that some matches are harder
        than others. A championship contender expects to win against the worst
        team in the league at home. They{"'"}re probably content with a draw to
        a championship rival.

      <Text>
        Football Pace looks at historical data for a league to see how many
        points a typical champion takes from each match, based on home/away and
        finishing position. Using that, it then creates a new version of the
        standings table, that shows how each team is doing compared to the
        {'"'}championship pace{'"'}, given their schedule so far.
